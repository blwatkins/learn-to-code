## `for...in` loop

Although the `for...in` loop can be used to iterate through the indices of an array, it is generally not recommended because it will return those indices as a `string` type, rather than the preferred `number` type.
Additionally, the `for...in` loop iterates over all enumerable properties of an object, including inherited properties.
